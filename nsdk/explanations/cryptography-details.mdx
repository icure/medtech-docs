# Cryptography in the cardinal SDK

:construction: This page is under construction :construction:

The cardinal SDK uses three main types of keys: personal encryption keys (RSA), exchange keys between two data owners
(AES), and entity encryption keys.

A user can use their personal encryption key to decrypt all exchange keys between themselves and another data owner.

A user can use their exchange keys to decrypt the encryption keys of entities created by them, or shared with them.
