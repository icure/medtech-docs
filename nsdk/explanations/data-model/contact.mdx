# Contact

The Contact is an encryptable root-level entity that records the medical information about the patient. A visit to the patient's house, a
consultation at the practice, a phone call between the patient and the healthcare party or integrating lab reports into
the medical file are examples of when a contact can be recorded.

A Contact can occur with or without direct interaction between the patient and the healthcare party. For example, when a
healthcare party encodes data received from laboratory's test result, this is done in the absence of a patient.

A Contact groups together pieces of information collected during one single event, for one single patient and for one or
more healthcare parties. Patient's complaints, the diagnosis of a new problem, a surgical procedure, etc. are collected
inside a Contact.

## Modifying a Closed Contact
Each Contact has an `openingDate` and `closingDate` that represent the moments when the moment of creation of medical
data starts and ends.

Once a contact is closed (i.e. its `closingDate` is not null), it is a good practice not to modify it anymore. Instead,
a new Contact should be created.

## Fields Encrypted by Default
By default, the following fields of this entity will be encrypted:
- `descr`
- The `markdown` field in all the `notes`.
- The Services in `service`, according to their [encryption configuration](/how-to/initialize-the-sdk/configure-what-to-encrypt#contact-service-and-service-content-encryption).

You can customize the encrypted fields as [explained in this how to](/how-to/initialize-the-sdk/configure-what-to-encrypt).

## Properties

Below you will find an explanation of the most commonly used properties in the entity that are not among the
[shared fields](/explanations/data-model/#shared-fields). For a full list, check the reference documentation (:construction:).

### closingDate
The `closingDate` represent the moment when the Contact ended.
It is encoded as a [FuzzyDateTime](/explanations/data-model/#fuzzydatetime).

### descr
A human-readable description for the Contact.

### encounterLocation
An address to record where the Contact took place.

### encounterType
A [CodeStub](/explanations/data-model/codestub) to give a context to the type of Contact using a standard terminology.

### groupId
The medical information contained into a single "logical" Contact can be separated into multiple Contact entities that
share the same `groupId`. This use case is explained in more details in [this how to](/how-to/contact-group-id).

### notes
A list of textual remarks related to this Contact.

### openingDate
The `openingDate` represent the starting moment of the event of the Contact.
It is encoded as a [FuzzyDateTime](/explanations/data-model/#fuzzydatetime).

### participants
The ids of all the other Data Owners that participated in this encounter, associated to their role in the encounter.

:::caution
This field is not encrypted by default, so be sure of not including any Patient id in this field as it will break the
anonymization between Contact and Patient.
:::

### services
A collection of [Service](/explanations/data-model/service)s that contain the value of the examinations performed
during the encounter.

### subContacts
A collection of [SubContact](/explanations/data-model/subcontact) to link to the containing Contact additional
medical context, like [HealthElement](/explanations/data-model/healthelement)s or therapeutic plans.
