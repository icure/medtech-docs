# Content

A Content is an encryptable nested entity that contains the value of the medical data to store in the cloud. It is nested 
inside [Service](/explanations/data-model/service), and it will always be encrypted before being saved in the cloud.

## Properties

Below you will find an explanation of the most commonly used properties in the entity that are not among the
[shared fields](/explanations/data-model/#shared-fields). For a full list, check the reference documentation (:construction:).

### binaryValue
Raw bytes to store in the Content.
- In Kotlin, it is a `ByteArray`.
- In Python, it is a `bytearray`.
- In Typescript, it is a `Int8Array`.

:::warning
This field is meant to contain only a short byte content (up to few kilobytes). Storing large amount of data in this field
can affect the performance of retrieving your data. 

Also, it is not possible to store any entity with a total size > 16Mb.

If you want to store large files / big binary content, you can store it in a [Document](/explanations/data-model/document)
and put the document id in the [documentId](/explanations/data-model/content#documentid) field of the Content.

More information about how to store large files are available in [this how to](/how-to/store-unstructured-data).
:::

### booleanValue
A boolean value to store in the Content.

### compoundValue
This field is used to store any complex structure that does not fit in any other field as a collection of nested 
[Service](/explanations/data-model/service)s. 

### documentId
The id of a [Document](/explanations/data-model/document) entity. This can be used to store large files as medical
content without having to include the file directly in the entity.

### fuzzyDateValue
A date to store in the Content as a [FuzzyDateTime](/explanations/data-model/#fuzzydatetime).

### instantValue
A timestamp to store in the Content.
 - In Kotlin, it is an `Instant` from [kotlinx-datetime](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-datetime).
 - In Python, it is the timestamp as `int`.
 - In Typescript, it is the timestamp as `number`.

### measureValue
The result of a measurement to store in the Content. Differently from `numberValue`, that only stores the value, in 
this field is also possible to store additional information about the measure, like the unit and the reference range.

### medicationValue
The details of a prescribed or suggested medication to store in the Content.

### numberValue
A raw numeric value to store in the Content. 
 - In Kotlin, it is a `Double`.
 - In Python, it is a `float`.
 - In Typescript, it is a `number`.

### stringValue
Textual value to store in the Content.

### timeSeries
A Content can store also time series / signal-like data, like the result of an [electrocardiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography).
This field can store any 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional signals, along with aggregated measures.
