# Document

A Document is an encryptable root-level entity that represents any kind of medical document, from reports to medical imaging
results. 

Differently from the other entities, the Document is designed to manage big files, that are stored as attachments of this
entity. Each Document can have a **main attachment** and multiple **secondary attachments**, that are fully encrypted
before being sent on the cloud. You can read more about store big files in Cardinal [here](/how-to/store-unstructured-data).

## Fields Encrypted by Default
In this entity, no field is encrypted by default. You can customize the encrypted fields as [explained in this how to](/how-to/initialize-the-sdk/configure-what-to-encrypt).
