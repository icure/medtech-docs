# User

A User is a non-encryptable, root-level entity that represents an actor that can log in to the system and perform actions
according to their permissions.

Only a user that is a data owner (i.e. is associated to a HealthcareParty, Patient, or Device) and has initialized their
own encryption keys can perform operations on the encryptable fields of encryptable entities. A user that is an admin or
that has the correct permission can access encryptable entities, but they will only be able to read and write the
non-encryptable fields.

For more information, check the explanation on [data owners and access control](/explanations/data-owners-and-access-control).

## Login Credentials
In order to login, a user must provide valid credentials (namely, a login and a password) to the Cardinal SDK.
Any of these field of the User entity is valid as login:
- `id`
- `login`
- `email`
- `mobilePhone`

As for the password, it is possible both to set a password (in the `passwordHash` field) or to use a [temporary token](/how-to/remember-me).

## Roles
The roles assigned to a User are stored in a nested object inside the `systemMetadata` property. It has 3 properties:

- `isAdmin` is a boolean field that is `true` if the user is an admin.
- `roles` is a set of the names of all the roles assigned to the user.
- `inheritsRoles` is a boolean field that is `true` if the user has no role set and so inherits the roles from the group
configuration.

Any update to this property will be prohibited by the backend. To learn how to update the roles on a user, check this [how to](/how-to/define-user-roles).

## Data Owner Users
A User is a **Data Owner** User if exactly one of the following is true:

- They have the id of a valid [HealthcareParty](/explanations/data-model/healthcareparty) in the `healthcarePartyId` field.
- They have the id of a valid [Patient](/explanations/data-model/patient) in the `patientId` field.
- They have the id of a valid [Device](/explanations/data-model/device) in the `deviceId` field.

:::caution
A User can be associate either to a HealthcareParty, or to a Patient, or to a Device, and it cannot be associated to
more than one of those entities.
:::

When a Data Owner logs in, the SDK loads their available encryption keys or creates new one if no key is available.
Then, the user will be able to create, modify and search encrypted data. You can read more about data owner users [here](/explanations/data-owners-and-access-control)

## Properties

Below you will find an explanation of the most commonly used properties in the entity that are not among the
[shared fields](/explanations/data-model/#shared-fields). For a full list, check the reference documentation (:construction:).

### authenticationTokens
Contains all the active authentication tokens for the user, where the hash of the token is replaced by the character
`*`.

This field is useful to check how many tokens are currently active and their duration, and it can be used to remove an
active token, by deleting it from the map.

While it is possible to manually creating a token by adding it to this map, it is preferable to use the `getToken` method
of the SDK. More information about application tokens can be found in [this how to](/how-to/remember-me).

### deviceId
The id of the [Device](/explanations/data-model/device) associated to this User. If this field is not null,
then the `healthcarePartyId` and `patientId` fields should be null.

:::info
A User where this field is not null is a **Data Owner** User.
:::

### email
The email of the User. It can be used as username to log in.

### groupId
The id of the group where this user belongs.

### healthcarePartyId
The id of the [HealthcareParty](/explanations/data-model/healthcareparty) associated to this User. If this field
is not null, then the `patientId` and `deviceId` fields should be null.

:::info
A User where this field is not null is a **Data Owner** User.
:::

### login
A username for the User. This field can be used in the log in phase.

### mobilePhone
The mobilePhone of the User. It can be used as username to log in.

### name
A free-text field that contains the name of the User.

### passwordHash
If the current User has a password, this field will contain the character `*`, otherwise it will be null.
This field can be used to create or update the password for the User. When the user is created or updated, if this field
contains a clear-text password, the backend will store it hashed and salted.

:::note
If a User logged in with a long token (i.e. an authentication token with a duration > 5 minutes), they will not be able
to create or update their own password or the password of any other user, even if they have the permission to do so.
:::

### patientId
The id of the [Patient](/explanations/data-model/patient) associated to this User. If this field is not null,
then the `healthcarePartyId` and `deviceId` fields should be null.

:::info
A User where this field is not null is a **Data Owner** User.
:::

### systemMetadata
This field contains internal information about the User. It has 3 properties:

- `isAdmin` is a boolean field that is `true` if the user is an admin.
- `roles` is a set of the ids of all the roles assigned to the user.
- `inheritsRoles` is a boolean field that is `true` if the user has no role set and so inherits the roles from the group
  configuration.

Any update to this property will be prohibited by the backend. To learn how to update the roles on a user, check this [how to](/how-to/define-user-roles).

### status
The status of the User. The values can be `Active`, `Disabled`, or `Registering`. Note that if a User has a `Disabled`
status, it will not be able to log in.
