# Modify user roles

The operations that a user can do on an entity are determined by two factors:

- The roles of the user.
- Whether the entity was shared with the user (if the entity is encryptable and the user a Data Owner).

This how-to focuses on assigning and removing roles from a user. You can read more about permissions and Data Owner
users in [this explanation](/explanations/data-owners-and-access-control).

## Check user roles
The user roles information are stored in the [systemMetadata](/explanations/data-model/user#systemmetadata) property.
This property has 3 fields: 

- `isAdmin` is a boolean field that is `true` if the user is an admin.
- `roles` is a set of the ids of all the roles assigned to the user.
- `inheritsRoles` is a boolean field that is `true` if the user has no role set and so inherits the default roles from 
the group configuration.

## Default Roles
Each database has its own default roles, that are set when the group is created. You can edit the default roles and 
check which permissions they grant in the Cockpit (:construction:).

Roles are assigned based on the user type:

- If the user is a HealthcareParty user (i.e. the `healthcarePartyId` field is not empty), it will receive all the `HCP` roles.
- If the user is a Patient user (i.e. the `patientId` field is not empty), it will receive all the `PATIENT` roles.
- If the user is a Device user (i.e. the `deviceId` field is not empty), it will receive all the `DEVICE` roles.
- If the user is not a Data Owner user, it will receive all the `USER` roles.

If you assign a new role to a User, it will lose all the default roles.

## Assign a role to a user
To assign a role to a user, you first need to identify which role you want to give. You can retrieve all the available
roles using the `getAllRoles` method in the `role` section of the sdk.

<LanguageTabs>

<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val allRoles = sdk.role.getAllRoles()
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="typescript">

```typescript
const allRoles = await sdk.role.getAllRoles()
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python">

```python
all_roles = sdk.role.get_all_roles_blocking()
```

</TabItem>

</LanguageTabs>

Then, you can update the roles for a user adding the id of the new role to the existing ones for the user. For the 
sake of the example, we will use the first role in the result.

<LanguageTabs>

<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val userId = // The id of the user to update
val user = sdk.user.getUser(userId)
sdk.user.addRolesToUser(userId, user.systemMetadata.roles + allRoles.first())
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="typescript">

```typescript
const userId = // The id of the user to update
const user = await sdk.user.getUser(userId)
await sdk.user.addRolesToUser(userId, user.systemMetadata.roles + allRoles[0])
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python">

```python
user_id =  # The id of the user to update
user = sdk.user.get_user_blocking(user_id)
sdk.user.add_roles_to_user_blocking(userId, user.system_metadata.roles + [all_roles[0]])
```

</TabItem>

</LanguageTabs>

Now the users has all their previous roles plus the new one.

:::warning
This operation sets the roles for a user, so it can be used both to add and remove roles: to add a role, just like in 
the example, you have to pass all the previous roles plus the ones that you want to add. To remove a role, you have to 
pass all the previous roles except for the one that you want to remove.
:::
:::note
You can also modify the roles of a user manually in the Cockpit (:construction:)
:::

## Reset user roles
To remove any role configuration from a user and revert it to the configuration defined in the group, you can use the 
`removeRolesFromUser` method of the SDK:

<LanguageTabs>

<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
sdk.user.removeRolesFromUser(userId)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="typescript">

```typescript
await sdk.user.removeRolesFromUser(userId)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python">

```python
sdk.user.remove_roles_from_user_blocking(userId)
```

</TabItem>

</LanguageTabs>

## Creating custom roles
It is not possible to create custom roles from existing permissions using Cardinal. However, this feature will be added
in a release in the near future.
