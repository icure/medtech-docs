# Authentication with a secret provider

## Overview

:::note
This feature is unavailable on the Cardinal Python SDK
:::

When you authenticate a user using the Cardinal SDK, you can choose among several types of credentials:

- Username + long token (i.e. an authentication token with a duration greater than 5 minutes, like the one used to
  [implement a remember me functionality](/how-to/remember-me)
- Username + short token (i.e. an authentication token with a duration less than or equal to 5 minutes)
- Username + password
- Username + OTP from two-factor authentication
- OAuth

:::info
To use the two-factor authentication to authorize a user, you need first to enable it as explained in [this how-to](/how-to/set-up-2fa).
:::

The secret provider is a callback that you can define to ask your user their credentials among one of those types. The
Cardinal SDK will then call it whenever it needs to get credentials from the user.

## Implement the secret provider

To implement a secret provider, you need to define a class that implements the `AuthSecretProvider` interface., that
defines a single method: `getSecret`. This is the method that will be called by the SDK whenever new credentials are needed;
it has 3 parameters that can be used in its implementation:

- `acceptedSecrets`: the types of credentials that will be accepted by the provider for that specific call. On certain
  operations (e.g. create a short token, enabling or disabling the 2FA) only the safest credentials option can be used.
  For more details, check the [sensitive operations](/how-to/initialize-the-sdk/authentication-with-secret-provider#sensitive-operations)
  section.
- `previousAttempts`: if the credentials returned by the method are invalid (the token expired, the user typed the
  password wrong, etc.) the `getSecret` method will be called again and this parameter will contain all the previous
  credentials type that were not valid. The first element of this array correspond to the oldest attempts, while the last
  element corresponds to the latest failed attempt.
- `authProcessApi`: an instance of the `AuthProcessApi` that can be used to create a short token for the user when needed.

Below you will find an example implementation of a secret provider.

### Instantiate the SDK with the secret provider

Once your secret provider is created, you can use it to instantiate the Cardinal SDK:

<LanguageTabs>

<TabItem value = "kotlin">

```kotlin
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.CardinalSdk
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.options.AuthenticationMethod
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.storage.impl.FileStorageFacade

val sdk = CardinalSdk.initialize(
	applicationId = null,
	baseUrl = "https://api.icure.cloud",
	authenticationMethod = AuthenticationMethod.UsingSecretProvider(
		secretProvider = secretProvider,
		loginUsername = ""/* The username for the login */,
		initialSecret = AuthenticationMethod.UsingSecretProvider.InitialSecret.Password("A password"),
		cacheSecrets = true /* Whether to try and cache credentials when possible */,
	),
	baseStorage = FileStorageFacade("./scratch/storage")
)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="typescript">

```typescript
import {
	AuthenticationMethod,
	CardinalSdk,
	SecretProviderAuthenticationOptions, 
	StorageFacade
} from "@icure/cardinal-sdk";

const sdk = await CardinalSdk.initialize(
	undefined,
	"https://api.icure.cloud",
	new AuthenticationMethod.UsingSecretProvider(
		secretProvider,
		{
			loginUsername: "", /* The username for the login */
			initialSecret: new SecretProviderAuthenticationOptions.InitialSecret.Password("A password"),
			cacheSecrets: true /* Whether to try and cache credentials when possible */,
		}
	),
	StorageFacade.usingBrowserLocalStorage()
)
```

</TabItem>

</LanguageTabs>

Along with the secret provider, you can also specify additional options to further customize the behaviour of your 
secret provider:

- `loginUsername`: the `login`, `email`, or `mobilePhone` of your user to per form the login. If you don't provide this
field, only the authentication methods that do not require a username (i.e. `DigitalId` and `ExternalAuthentication`) can 
be used.
- `initialSecret`: an existing, valid secret for the user that can be used to login. You can use either the password, a 
long-lived token or the token from an OAuth authentication flow. If the initial secret is not passed, the SDK will 
immediately ask for credentials using the secret provider.
- `cacheSecret`: if true, the SDK instance will cache the secrets provided by the user in the volatile memory, to try 
and minimize the secrets asked to the user.

## Sensitive operations
The different types of credentials that the secret provider can ask and use are not deemed equal in terms of security.
In fact, they are ranked as follows (from the more secure to the least secure):

- `DigitalId`
- `TwoFactorAuthentication`
- `ShortLivedToken`
- `ExternalAuthentication`
- `Password`
- `LongLivedToken`

In the SDK, some operations are deemed safety critical and can only be executed if a user logged in with credentials 
considered safe enough, even if it has the appropriate permission to do so. In those cases, the SDK will use the 
secret provider to ask new safe credentials to the user.

The minimum required credentials for all the safe operations can be modifying the `minimumAuthenticationClassForElevatedPrivileges`
property through the `GroupApi`. 
By default, this value is set to `Password`.

### Example: creating a short-lived token
As short-lived token are considered safe credentials, creating one requires an elevated security context.

Let's take into account a use case where the sdk was initialized with a secret provider and an initial long token:

<LanguageTabs>

<TabItem value = "kotlin">

```kotlin
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.CardinalSdk
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.options.AuthenticationMethod
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.storage.impl.FileStorageFacade

val sdk = CardinalSdk.initialize(
	applicationId = null,
	baseUrl = "https://api.icure.cloud",
	authenticationMethod = AuthenticationMethod.UsingSecretProvider(
		secretProvider = secretProvider,
		loginUsername = /*The username*/,
		initialSecret = AuthenticationMethod.UsingSecretProvider.InitialSecret.LongLivedToken(/*Your existing long token*/),
		cacheSecrets = true,
	),
	baseStorage = FileStorageFacade("./scratch/storage")
)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="typescript">

```typescript
import {
	AuthenticationMethod,
	CardinalSdk,
	SecretProviderAuthenticationOptions, 
	StorageFacade
} from "@icure/cardinal-sdk";

const sdk = await CardinalSdk.initialize(
	undefined,
	"https://api.icure.cloud",
	new AuthenticationMethod.UsingSecretProvider(
		secretProvider,
		{
			loginUsername: /*The username*/,
			initialSecret: new SecretProviderAuthenticationOptions.InitialSecret.LongLivedToken(/*Your existing long token*/),
			cacheSecrets: true,
		}
	),
	StorageFacade.usingBrowserLocalStorage()
)
```

</TabItem>

</LanguageTabs>

Since the `loginUsername` to long token combination is valid for most operations, the user will not be asked additional
credentials for their initial operations.

However, if they try to create a short token:

<LanguageTabs>

<TabItem value = "kotlin">

```kotlin
val user = sdk.user.getCurrentUser()
val token = sdk.user.getToken(user.id, "test token", 600)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="typescript">

```typescript
const user = await sdk.user.getCurrentUser()
const token = await sdk.user.getToken(user.id, "test token", 600)
```

</TabItem>

</LanguageTabs>

Then the User will be asked for more secure credentials through the secret provider. In this case, the `acceptedSecret`
parameter of the `getSecret` function will only contain the credential type that are as safe or more safe as the threshold
specified in the group (so `Password` or higher in the default case).

If the user provides valid credentials, it will be responsibility of the SDK to ensure that the original operation 
completes successfully without any additional step.

### Sensitive operations list
The following operations are considered safety critical and will require stronger credentials compared to the rest:

- Create a short token
- Enable or disable the two-factor authentication for a user.
- Modify the password or the roles for a user.
- Hard-delete a group.
