# Querying data

This page explains how you can use the iCure SDK to query stored data.

## Filter options

Filter options are at the core of queries in iCure. For each kind of entity, the SDK provides a factory that allows
you to create various types of filter options that check different properties on the entities.

For example, you can create filter options that match all healthcare parties with a name (first or last name) that
contains "joh":

<LanguageTabs>

<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.filters.HealthcarePartyFilters

val hcpWithName = HealthcarePartyFilters.byName("joh")
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="typescript">

```typescript
import {HealthcarePartyFilters} from "@icure/cardinal-sdk";

const hcpWithName = HealthcarePartyFilters.byName("joh")
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python">

```python
from cardinal_sdk.filters import HealthcarePartyFilters

hcpWithName = HealthcarePartyFilters.by_name("joh")
```

</TabItem>

</LanguageTabs>


:::info

In this page we're showing how to use filter options for querying data, but they're also used in other contexts.
For example, when setting up a realtime event listener, you need to provide filter options which will determine the
entities for which you will get a notification.

:::

:::note

In this page we only explain the concepts of filter options and how they can be used for querying.

If you want a comprehensive list of the available filter options refer to the code documentation (:construction:)

:::

### Data owners in filters

:::info

[This section will be clearer if you have a good understanding of data owners and access control in iCure.](/explanations/data-owners-and-access-control)

:::

For the entities where the access control policy is entity-based, the filter options always require you to provide a
data owner id.
In these cases, the filter will match only entities the provided data owner can "access" (with some limitations,
explained later).

For convenience, since you usually need to retrieve data that is accessible to the current data owner, the factory
methods for these filter options come in two versions:
- A *for-self* version (for example `PatientFilters.byIdentifiersForSelf`) where the data owner id is automatically filled
with the current data owner id. Unless you're using a special configuration for data owners ([such as hierarchical
healthcare parties](/how-to/share-data-with-many-users.mdx)), you should only be using these filter options in your application for the end-users.
- A *for-data-owner* version (for example `PatientFilters.byIdentifiersForDataOwner`) where you need to explicit specify
the id of the data owner.
Unless you're using a special configuration for data owners ([such as hierarchical healthcare parties](/how-to/share-data-with-many-users.mdx)), this is
only needed when you're querying the data as a non-data-owner user.
For example, this could be the case if you, acting as the system administrator, are compiling some statistics on the
patients registered to your app.
Note that using a for-data-owner filter option with a data owner id other than the current data owner id may require
special permissions, depending on which method they're used for.

#### Access for filter options

:::info

We recommend you understand the concepts of [hierarchical healthcare parties](/how-to/share-data-with-many-users.mdx)]
and pseudo-anonymised data owners (:construction:) before you read this section.

:::

Previously, we said that in the filter options for EBAC entities, you need to specify the id of a data owner and the
filter options will only match entities that the provided data owner can access.
While, this is true in basic scenarios, if you're using hierarchical healthcare parties or anonymous delegations for data
owners (which is usually the case when you have patient data owners), this is not entirely correct: there may be cases
where a data owner has access to an entity, but the filter for that data owner does not return that entity.

When you're using a hierarchical data owner configuration, the filter options won't be taking the data owner hierarchy in
consideration: for example, if a child HCP has access to an entity only through a parent HCP, any filter option *for-self*
will not return that entity.
To get that entity the child HCP needs to use *for-data-owner* filter options with the parent id.

Similarly, when using filter options for a data owner that has anonymous delegations, only that data owner will be able
to find the entities that he can access only through an anonymous delegation.
Due to the nature of anonymous delegations, all other users, regardless of their permissions, will not be able to find
these entities.

### Combining filter options

Filter options can be used individually, but you often need to query data using multiple conditions that can't be
covered by one filter option alone.

The SDK provides you three different operations that can be used to combine filter options:
- *intersection* takes two or more filter options and returns filter options that match the entities that match all
provided filters
- *union* takes two or more filter options and returns filter options that match the entities matching at least one of
the provided filters
- *difference* takes in input exactly two filter options and returns filter options that match entities that are matching
the first provided filter but not the second.

In the following example we use these operators to get filter options that match all male patients born between 1960 and
2000 and all female patients born between 1950 and 2000.

## Retrieve entities matching a filter

To retrieve the entities matching the filter options you've created you can use the filter and match methods of the
corresponding api.

The match method returns the ids of all the entity matching the provided filter options.

<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin

import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.CardinalSdk
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.filters.FilterOptions
import com.icure.cardinal.sdk.model.Patient

	sdk.patient.matchPatientsBy(patientFilterOptions)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="typescript">

```typescript
import {FilterOptions, CardinalSdk, Patient} from "@icure/cardinal-sdk";

function getIdsOfPatientsMatching(sdk: CardinalSdk, patientFilterOptions: FilterOptions<Patient>): Promise<Array<string>> {
	return sdk.patient.matchPatientsBy(patientFilterOptions)
}
```

</TabItem>

	return sdk.patient.match_patients_by_blocking(patient_filter_options)

```

</LanguageTabs>

The filter method returns an iterator that retrieves the matching entities from the backend over multiple pages if needed.
For encryptable entities this method is flavoured: the method on the main api returns the decrypted entities, but you
can also retrieve the entities using the encrypted and polymorphic flavours.

### Sorted queries

Some filter options are sortable, meaning that you can use them to sort data according to certain properties as defined
by the filter options.

If you want to retrieve sorted data using sortable filter options you can use the filterSorted/matchSorted variant
of the filter/match method. If you don't need sorted data, you should always prefer using the standard version of
the filter/match method, as it may be faster, depending on the actual query.

:::note

You may notice that sometimes data is consistently sorted according to the filter options even when using the standard
variant of the filter/match method.
However, this may change across different versions of the iCure SDK or backend, therefore, if you need your data to be
sorted, you should switch to the sorted variant of the method.

:::

In some cases, composite filter options are also sortable: if the first filter options of an intersection or difference
are sortable, then the resulting filter options are sortable using the criteria of those options, regardless of the
sortability of the other provided options. Union filter options are never sortable.

For example, you can create a filter that gets all diagnoses (health element) of long or acute covid for a certain patient,
sorting from most to least recent:

## Cross-entity queries

Sometimes you need to perform queries that span across multiple types of entities.
For example, you may want to get all heart rate measurements (services) for patients born between within a certain year
range.

In iCure, you can achieve this by querying first for one entity, then use the result of the first query to build the
filter options for the second entity.
Referring back to the previous example, we first get all patients born within the chosen range (in the code sample
1990 and 2000), then we get all the services that have a tag for heart rate measurement and are linked to one of the
retrieved patients.

Note that this requires that the user performing the query has access to all the [secret ids](/explanations/encrypted-links) of the patients
obtained from the first query.
If not, some items will be missing from the final result.

### Cross-entity queries with data denormalization.

An alternative approach to the two-step query proposed early is to denormalize your data: if you know that you will
often need to query services based on the gender and age of the patient, you may start adding some custom tags to each
service containing the patient's year of birth.

An advantage of this approach is that you wouldn't need to get the patients to perform a patient-service cross-entity
query, and more importantly, you don't need to have access to the secret ids of the patients.

However, this approach has some major flaws.

The first and most obvious flaw is that the duplicated has some cost, in terms of storage space, amounts of data
transferred, but most importantly maintenance: today you want to filter services using only the age of the patients, but
what if tomorrow you also want to filter depending on the gender of the patient?
If you only added a tag for the patient's year of birth, you will have to either update all the services or go back to
performing the query in two steps.

The other flaw of this approach is that any patient information we add to the service could be used to de-anonymize
the patients.
Today (in the 2020s) if we add to the services a tag that says the patient was born between the years 1940 and 1950,
we're significantly restricting the set of patients that the service could be referring to.
We're still probably within a safe range, but what about 10 years from now?
The number of patients born between 1940 and 1950 will be drastically reduced, making de-anonymization of these patients
simpler and simpler, especially when this information is combined with the metadata added by iCure.

In general, this approach is much more challenging to manage and implement properly.
Unless you're certain that this brings value to your solution, and that it will not harm the privacy of your users we
recommend you to avoid this.
