# Registering users

There are two primary approaches you can use to enroll new users in your application using the Cardinal SDK:
self-registration and invitation-based registration.

The self-registration approach allows new users to register autonomously through your application by providing basic 
information such as their email address, name, and other details.
For example, you could do use this approach in a patient-oriented digital wellbeing application. 

The invitation-based approach, on the other hand, requires that new users are invited by administrators or other users 
with certain permissions.
For example, you could use this approach in an EHR application for general practitioners, which will be invited directly
by you.
Meanwhile, a related application that allows patients to view digital prescriptions created through the first 
application could have the doctors inviting their patients.

You can also combine both approaches in your applications.
For example, HCP users might require an invitation, while patient users can register autonomously.

## Implementing user self-registration


If you want to allow users to self-register in your application, you first need to create a registration process for the
application through the cockpit (:construction:).

You can register the user to your application by initializing an instance of the Cardinal SDK using the registration 
process id. 
For more information on how to instantiate the SDK using a process, refer to the 
[SDK initialization documentation](/how-to/initialize-the-sdk/#authentication-with-a-process).

:::note

Since authentication with processes is not supported on the Cardinal python SDK you can't have user self-registration
on python applications.

:::info

After registration, the user can login again using the same process as for registration, since registration processes 
can also work as login processes.
However, if you want to use a different template for the login email or sms you will need to create a login process.

Alternatively, immediately after the first login you can ask the user to initialize a password, which they will be able
to use for future login.

:::

## Implementing user invitation

If you want to allow users to register only through invitation, you first need to create a login process for the
application or for the solution through the cockpit (:construction:).
Make sure to not create a registration process instead, as this could allow malicious actors to retrieve the process 
ID from your application and use it to register users bypassing the invitation requirement.

To implement the invitation system, you will have to use the Cardinal SDK to create the data owner for the new user (if
it doesn't already exist), and a user linked to the data owner. 
You need to specify at least the email or mobile phone for the newly created user, otherwise they will not be able to 
login.

## Patient user cryptography initialization

When a patient user logs in for the first time, there are a few scenarios that could occur:
- The patient is self-registered, so their information exists on the backend but has no associated encryption metadata.
- The patient user was created starting from an existing patient, and there is already some encryption metadata for the
  patient, but the patient can't access it.
  This could also happen if the patient had lost his previous private key and had to create a new one.

In these cases, the SDK will have two main limitations:
- The SDK won't be able to use encrypted fields of the patient entity, due to the lack of an (accessible) encryption key
- The SDK won't be able to create any data linked to the patient (like contacts or health element), due to the lack of
  an (accessible) secret id.

Since this is usually an issue for most applications, the SDK provides a method that you can use to initialize the
encryption metadata of the current user's patient.
The `ensureEncryptionMetadataForSelfIsInitialized` method of the patient api will:
- Initialize an encryption key and secret id for the patient if there is no encryption metadata initialized
- Initialize a secret id for the patient if the encryption metadata is already initialized, and there is no secret id 
  available to the current user.
- If there is already a secret id available to the current user the method does nothing.

This way you can be sure that the SDK will be able to at least create data linked to the current patient.

:::note

In cases where a doctor invited the patient user, we recommend [pre-sharing the patient information](#pre-share) instead
of creating a new secret id through the `ensureEncryptionMetadataForSelfIsInitialized` method.

:::

### Ensuring the doctor can find data created by the patient

If there was already some encryption metadata initialized for the current user's patient, and the
`ensureEncryptionMetadataForSelfIsInitialized` created a new [secret id](/explanations/encrypted-links) for it,
any data owner that had access to the patient won't be able to find new data you created by the patient when they use 
[filters](/how-to/querying-data).

If you want to make sure that other users will be able to find the data created by the patient user you can pass the
id of those data owners to the `ensureEncryptionMetadataForSelfIsInitialized` method.
This will cause any encryption metadata created by that method to be immediately shared with these data owners (note 
that this also includes the encryption key if the patient had no encryption metadata initialized).

## Pre-sharing data with invited patients {#pre-share}

A common scenario that may occur in your application is a patient being invited during a doctor's visit.
In this scenario the doctor wants to immediately share the data from the current visit (and potentially past visits)
with the patient so that they can see it as soon as they log in.
However, the patient typically won't log in during the visit and, as a result, won't have any keypair generated.
Since the SDK forbids sharing data with data owners who don't have a keypair (as this is usually a mistake), the 
doctor will be unable to share the data right after inviting the patient using the standard sharing mechanisms.

To cover this specific scenario, the Cardinal SDK provides a method to allow you to forcefully start sharing data with a
patient even if they don't have yet initialized a keypair.

The full process is:

1. Use the doctor SDK to call the `forceInitializeExchangeDataToNewlyInvitedPatient` method on the patient API. 
   This will initialize the metadata necessary to share data from the doctor to the patient even if the patient has no
   keypair, returning true if it was indeed necessary.
2. Use the doctor SDK to share all data that the patient needs to access using the standard "share with" methods of the 
   various [entities apis](/how-to/basic-operations#sharing).
3. If the method at step 1 returned `true`, the exchange data that was forcefully initialized (and therefore all data
   shared at step 2) will not be immediately accessible to the patient. 
   To complete the sharing procedure, you will need to:
   1. Create exchange data recovery information for the patient using the doctor's SDK.
   2. Give the key to the recovery data to the patient.
      This could be done using physical means, such as a custom QR code, or using an email. 
   3. When the patient logins and initializes a keypair they can provide the recovery key to get access to all the 
      pre-shared.
      In this case you shouldn't use the `ensureEncryptionMetadataForSelfIsInitialized` until after using the recovery 
      key, since the doctor may have pre-shared the patient, or if you're certain of it, there is no need to use the
      method at all.  
4. The doctor can still share more data like in step 2 without having to recreate the exchange data recovery information.

The process on the doctor app side could be:
