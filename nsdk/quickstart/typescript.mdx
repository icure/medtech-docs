# Typescript

To use the Cardinal SDK in Typescript, you can install it using yarn:
```bash
yarn add @icure/cardinal-sdk
```
You can also use npm:
```bash
npm install @icure/cardinal-sdk
```

We strongly recommend using [strict null checks](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strictNullChecks) when 
developing your application.

:::note

To use the Cardinal SDK on node, you need node 19 or greater.

## Template app

We provide a [template for TypeScript](https://github.com/icure/cardinal-introductory-tutorial) that showcases several self-contained use cases that highlight the main features of the Cardinal SDK.

### Launching the Tutorial in Typescript
To run the tutorial in Typescript, clone this repository:

```typescript
git clone https://github.com/icure/cardinal-introductory-tutorial.git
cd cardinal-introductory-tutorial
```

The minimum supported Node version is 19. You can install it using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

```typescript
nvm install 19
nvm use 19
```

Then, you can navigate to the typescript directory and install the required dependencies using yarn.

```typescript
cd typescript
yarn install
```

Finally, run the example Typescript code using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```typescript
yarn ts-node --esm src/main.ts
```

## Boilerplate

We provide a [boilerplate for React](https://github.com/icure/cardinal-sdk-react-js-template) that already includes
the dependencies, the registration/login flow, and some example usage of the sdk.
