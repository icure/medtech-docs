# Cardinal SDK Introductory Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will discover how the Cardinal solution can be used in common digital health scenarios to create,
search and share medical data.

Before starting, be sure to follow the [onboarding procedure](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-create-your-account) to register to
Cardinal and create database and [create a healthcare party user to the database](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-manage-hcp).

The examples may use some functions (e.g. to create UUIDs or date in the YYYMMMDD format), that are not defined by the 
language nor described in the code samples. This is intentional, to let the examples focus on the Cardinal SDK code, and 
it is especially true for the Dart examples, where all the UI code is left out. You can check the full code examples in
the GitHub repository to have the whole picture.

:::note
Be sure to [generate an authentication token](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-manage-hcp#generating-an-authentication-token) (i.e.
a temporary password) for your healthcare party to be able to instantiate the SDK in the code examples.

:::note
The full code examples in Kotlin, Python, and TypeScript are available [in this repo](https://github.com/icure/cardinal-introductory-tutorial), 
where you will find a folder for each language.

The Dart code is available [in this repo](https://github.com/icure/cardinal-dart-introductory-tutorial) along with the instructions to run it on the Android and iOS simulator.
