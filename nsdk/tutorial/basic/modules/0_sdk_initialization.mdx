# Initialize the SDK

After you have [created a first database and a healthcare party user with a token](/tutorial/basic/sdk-basic-tutorial),
you can use those credentials to instantiate a new iCure SDK.

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

In the following example, the username and password are retrieved from the standard input:

```kotlin
private const val CARDINAL_URL = "https://api.icure.cloud"

print("Login: ")
val username = readln().trim()
print("Password: ")
val password = readln().trim()
val sdk = CardinalSdk.initialize(
	applicationId = null,
	baseUrl = CARDINAL_URL,
	authenticationMethod = AuthenticationMethod.UsingCredentials(
		UsernamePassword(username, password)
	),
	baseStorage = FileStorageFacade("./scratch/storage")
)
```

The `initialize` function creates an instance of the SDK with the provided username and password. It also attempts to
load existing cryptographic keys for the user from the `./scratch/storage` folder. If no key is found for the user in
that folder, a new cryptographic key will be generated and stored there.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

In the following example, the username and password are retrieved from the standard input:

```python
CARDINAL_URL = "https://api.icure.cloud"

username = input("Username: ")
password = input("Password: ")
sdk = CardinalSdk(
	application_id=None,
	baseurl=CARDINAL_URL,
	authentication_method=UsernamePassword(username, password),
	storage_facade=FileSystemStorage("./scratch/storage")
)
```

The `initialize` function creates an instance of the SDK with the provided username and password. It also attempts to
load existing cryptographic keys for the user from the `./scratch/storage` folder. If no key is found for the user in
that folder, a new cryptographic key will be generated and stored there.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

In the following example, the username and password are retrieved from the standard input:

```typescript
const CARDINAL_URL = "https://api.icure.cloud"

const username = await readLn("Login: ")
const password = await readLn("Password: ")
const sdk = CardinalSdk.initialize(
	undefined,
	CARDINAL_URL,
	new AuthenticationMethod.UsingCredentials.UsernamePassword(username, password),
	StorageFacade.usingFileSystem("./scratch/storage")
)
```

The `initialize` function creates an instance of the SDK with the provided username and password. It also attempts to
load existing cryptographic keys for the user from the `./scratch/storage` folder. If no key is found for the user in
that folder, a new cryptographic key will be generated and stored there.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dart">

In the following example, the function initializes an SDK with a username and a password retrieved from the app UI:

```dart
const cardinalUrl = "https://api.icure.cloud";

Future<CardinalSdk> createSdk(String username, String password) async {
  final sdk = await CardinalSdk.initialize(
      null,
      cardinalUrl,
      AuthenticationMethod.UsingCredentials(Credentials.UsernamePassword(username, password)),
      StorageOptions.PlatformDefault
  );
  return sdk;
}
```

The `initialize` function creates an instance of the SDK with the provided username and password. It also attempts to
load existing cryptographic keys for the user from the native storage implementation (Androidx DataStore for Android,
NSUserDefaults for iOS, iPadOS, macOS & watchOS). If no key is found for the user, a new cryptographic key will be generated 
and stored.
