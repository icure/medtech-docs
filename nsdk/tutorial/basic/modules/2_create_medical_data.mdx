# Create and Encrypt Medical Data

The example in this section demonstrates how to register a medical examination, where some medical exams are performed
and a diagnosis is elaborated.

## Initiating a Medical Examination

In Cardinal, the concept of a medical examination is represented through the `Contact` entity. Generally, a `Contact`
represents a moment when medical data are produced and involves a patient and, usually, one or more healthcare actors.
As the first step, the user can choose to use an existing Patient or create a new one:

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
print("Insert the id of a Patient (blank to create a new one): ")
val patientId = readlnOrNull()
val patient = if (patientId.isNullOrBlank()) {
	sdk.patient.createPatient(
		DecryptedPatient(
			id = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
			firstName = "Annabelle",
			lastName = "Hall",
		).let { sdk.patient.withEncryptionMetadata(it) }
	)
} else {
	sdk.patient.getPatient(patientId)
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
patient_id = input("Insert the id of a Patient (blank to create a new one): ")
if len(patient_id) == 0:
	patient = sdk.patient.create_patient_blocking(
		sdk.patient.with_encryption_metadata_blocking(
			DecryptedPatient(
				id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
				first_name="Annabelle",
				last_name="Hall"
			)
		)
	)
else:
	patient = sdk.patient.get_patient_blocking(patient_id)
```

</TabItem>
</LanguageTabs>

Next, a new `Contact` is instantiated with a custom description provided by the user:

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyyMMddHHmmss")
print("Examination description: ")
val description = readln().trim()
val contact = DecryptedContact(
	id = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
	descr = description,
	openingDate = LocalDateTime.now().format(formatter).toLong()
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
description = input("Examination description: ")
contact = DecryptedContact(
	id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
	descr=description,
	opening_date=int(datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S"))
)
```

</TabItem>
</LanguageTabs>

A `Contact` is an encryptable entity, so a `DecryptedContact` is used when instantiating it. Besides the description,
both the `id` and `openingDate` must be set. The `openingDate` represents the moment when the medical examination
starts. Generally, it marks the beginning of the event during which medical data are created.

Being an encryptable entity, the encryption metadata need to be initialized before creating the `Contact`, just as with the `Patient`:

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val contactWithMetadata = sdk.contact.withEncryptionMetadata(contact, patient)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
contact_with_metadata = sdk.contact.with_encryption_metadata_blocking(contact, patient)
```

</TabItem>
</LanguageTabs>

In this case, the initialization step differs slightly from that of the patient. The function takes two parameters as
input: the contact itself and a patient. This is because the metadata will also include a link to the Patient who is
the subject of this examination. To prevent data leaks, this link is encrypted, and only users with access to the
contact will be able to decipher it.

Finally, the `Contact` can be encrypted and stored in the cloud:

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val createdContact = sdk.contact.createContact(contactWithMetadata)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
created_contact = sdk.contact.create_contact_blocking(contact_with_metadata)
```

</TabItem>
</LanguageTabs>

## Registering Medical Data

After the `Contact` is created, you can add medical data to it. Medical information is registered using a
`Service` encryptable entity nested within a `Contact`. In the following examples, data in different formats will be
added to the contact that was just created.

### Creating Scalar Medical Data (Blood Pressure)

The first piece of information added to the contact is a blood pressure measurement. In the following snippet, a
`Service` (using its `DecryptedService` variation, since `Service` is an encryptable entity) is instantiated with the
result of the exam:

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val bloodPressureService = DecryptedService(
	id = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
	label = "Blood pressure",
	identifier = listOf(Identifier(system = "cardinal", value = "bloodPressure")),
	content = mapOf(
		"en" to DecryptedContent(
			measureValue = Measure(
				value = Random.nextInt(80, 120).toDouble(),
				unit = "mmHg"
			)
		)
	)
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
blood_pressure_service = DecryptedService(
	id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
	label="Blood pressure",
	identifier=[Identifier(system="cardinal", value="bloodPressure")],
	content={
		"en": DecryptedContent(
			measure_value=Measure(
				value=float(random.randint(80, 120)),
				unit="mmHg"
			)
		)
	}
)
```

</TabItem>
</LanguageTabs>

In this case, a free-text `label` provides a description for the `Service`, and an `identifier` allows for a
more structured labeling.

:::warning
When adding sensitive information to an encryptable entity, always remember that not all fields are encrypted.
You can customize the encrypted fields as explained in [this how to](/nsdk/how-to/configure-what-to-encrypt).
:::

The actual measurement is stored in the `content` of the `Service`. This field is a map that associates an
[ISO language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) with `Content`. In this case,
the content contains a measure value that holds the blood pressure result and its unit.

The `Service` can now be added to the existing `Contact`:

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val contactWithBloodPressure = sdk.contact.modifyContact(
	createdContact.copy(
		services = setOf(bloodPressureService)
	)
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
created_contact.services = [blood_pressure_service]
contact_with_blood_pressure = sdk.contact.modify_contact_blocking(
	created_contact
)
```

</TabItem>
</LanguageTabs>

It is worth noting that even though `Service` is an encryptable entity, there is no need to call the
`withEncryptionMetadata` method because the entity is nested within another encryptable entity and will inherit
its encryption metadata. This means that if the enclosing entity was shared with another user,
the nested entity will automatically be shared as well.

### Creating Signal-like Medical Data (Electrocardiography)

A `Service` can also hold time-series data, signals, and, in general, vector-like data. In the following example,
the resulting signal from an [ECG (Electrocardiography)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography) exam is
added to the `Contact` through a `Service`:

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val ecgSignal = List(10) { Random.nextInt(0, 100) / 100.0 }
val heartRateService = DecryptedService(
	id = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
	identifier = listOf(Identifier(system = "cardinal", value = "ecg")),
	label = "Heart rate",
	content = mapOf(
		"en" to DecryptedContent(
			timeSeries = TimeSeries(
				samples = listOf(ecgSignal)
			)
		)
	)
)
val contactWithECG = sdk.contact.modifyContact(
	contactWithBloodPressure.copy(
		services = contactWithBloodPressure.services + heartRateService
	)
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
ecg_signal = [round(float(random.uniform(0, 1)), 2) for _ in range(10)]
heart_rate_service = DecryptedService(
	id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
	identifier=[Identifier(system="cardinal", value="ecg")],
	label="Heart rate",
	content={
		"en": DecryptedContent(
			time_series=TimeSeries(
				samples=[ecg_signal]
			)
		)
	}
)
contact_with_blood_pressure.services = contact_with_blood_pressure.services + [heart_rate_service]
contact_with_ecg = sdk.contact.modify_contact_blocking(contact_with_blood_pressure)
```

</TabItem>
</LanguageTabs>

The structure of this `Service` is almost identical to that of the previous example, with the only difference being
that the medical data are stored as `timeSeries` in the Content instead of `measureValue`. A `TimeSeries` entity
can contain both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional signals, as well as aggregated data such as minimum, maximum, and
average values.

### Creating Medical Image Data

Due to their larger size, the process of uploading medical images (such as those from X-Ray or CT exams, as well as
simple photos) differs from uploading single measurements or signals. This difference is intended to avoid
performance loss when querying and retrieving entities that contain large files.

:::note
A `Content` has a `binaryData` field that can be used to store binary data, but for the aforementioned reasons,
it should not be used to store large amounts of data.
:::

The first step in uploading a medical image (or another large file) is to create a new `Document` entity.
A `Document` is an encryptable entity that represents medical documents (e.g., reports, certificates, images) in any format.

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val document = DecryptedDocument(
	id = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
	documentType = DocumentType.Labresult
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
document = DecryptedDocument(
	id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
	document_type=DocumentType.Labresult
)
```

</TabItem>
</LanguageTabs>

In this example, a new `DecryptedDocument` is instantiated with the type set to a laboratory result. Since a `Document`
is encryptable, the encryption metadata must be initialized before it is created on the cloud.

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val createdDocument = sdk.document.createDocument(
	sdk.document.withEncryptionMetadata(document, null)
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
created_document = sdk.document.create_document_blocking(
	sdk.document.with_encryption_metadata_blocking(document, None)
)
```

</TabItem>
</LanguageTabs>

Note that in this case, the `withEncryptionMetadata` method takes a null second parameter. This is because there is no
need to link the `Document` directly to the `Patient`, as the document will be linked to a `Service` that, in turn,
will be linked to the `Patient`.

Next, you can load the image as an attachment to the `Document`. A `Document` can have a single main attachment and
multiple secondary attachments. In this case, an "image" is loaded as the main attachment to the document.

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val xRayImage = Random.nextBytes(100)
val documentWithAttachment = sdk.document.encryptAndSetMainAttachment(
	document = createdDocument,
	utis = listOf("public.tiff"),
	attachment = xRayImage
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
x_ray_image = bytearray(secrets.token_bytes(100))
document_with_attachment = sdk.document.encrypt_and_set_main_attachment_blocking(
	document=created_document,
	utis=["public.tiff"],
	attachment=x_ray_image
)
```

</TabItem>
</LanguageTabs>

The bytes composing the image are encrypted and set as the attachment of the `Document`. Information about the
[UTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Type_Identifier) of the attachment is also set.

Finally, it is possible to link this `Document` with a new `Service` representing the X-Ray image and add it to the `Contact`.

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val xRayService = DecryptedService(
	id = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
	label = "X-Ray image",
	identifier = listOf(Identifier(system = "cardinal", value = "xRay")),
	content = mapOf(
		"en" to DecryptedContent(
			documentId = documentWithAttachment.id
		)
	)
)
val contactWithImage = sdk.contact.modifyContact(
	contactWithECG.copy(
		services = contactWithECG.services + xRayService
	)
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
x_ray_service = DecryptedService(
	id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
	label="X-Ray image",
	identifier=[Identifier(system="cardinal", value="xRay")],
	content={
		"en": DecryptedContent(
			document_id=document_with_attachment.id
		)
	}
)
contact_with_ecg.services = contact_with_ecg.services + [x_ray_service]
contact_with_image = sdk.contact.modify_contact_blocking(contact_with_ecg)
```

</TabItem>
</LanguageTabs>

## Adding a Diagnosis

Diagnoses and other medical contexts that define the health condition of a patient are represented by a
`HealthElement` encryptable entity. In this example, the user will create a `HealthElement` containing the
diagnosis elaborated after the examination.

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
print("What is the diagnosis?: ")
val diagnosis = readln().trim()
val healthElement = DecryptedHealthElement(
	id = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
	descr = diagnosis
)
val createdDiagnosis = sdk.healthElement.createHealthElement(
	sdk.healthElement.withEncryptionMetadata(healthElement, patient)
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
diagnosis = input("What is the diagnosis?: ")
health_element = DecryptedHealthElement(
	id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
	descr=diagnosis
)
created_diagnosis = sdk.health_element.create_health_element_blocking(
	sdk.health_element.with_encryption_metadata_blocking(health_element, patient)
)
```

</TabItem>
</LanguageTabs>

A `HealthElement` is an encryptable entity, so like a `Contact`, first a `DecryptedHealthElement`
is instantiated with the desired information. Then, the encryption metadata are initialized, linking the
`HealthElement` to a Patient and sharing the entity with the current user. Finally, the entity is created.

It is possible to associate the `HealthElement` with a `Contact` by linking it to a `SubContact`:

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val contactWithDiagnosis = sdk.contact.modifyContact(
	contactWithImage.copy(
		subContacts = setOf(DecryptedSubContact(
			descr = "Diagnosis",
			healthElementId = createdDiagnosis.id
		))
	)
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
contact_with_image.sub_contacts = [
	DecryptedSubContact(
		descr="Diagnosis",
		health_element_id=created_diagnosis.id
	)
]
contact_with_diagnosis = sdk.contact.modify_contact_blocking(contact_with_image)
```

</TabItem>
</LanguageTabs>

## Closing the Examination

To indicate that the medical examination has concluded, you can set the `closingDate` on the corresponding `Contact`.
This action signifies that the data collection session is finished and, ideally, that the `Contact` will not be
modified further.

<LanguageTabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val finalContact = sdk.contact.modifyContact(
	contactWithDiagnosis.copy(
		closingDate = LocalDateTime.now().format(formatter).toLong()
	)
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
contact_with_diagnosis.closing_date = int(datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S"))
final_contact = sdk.contact.modify_contact_blocking(contact_with_diagnosis)
```

</TabItem>
</LanguageTabs>

Like `openingDate`, the `closingDate` is an instant, precise to the second, represented in the `YYYYMMDDhhmmss` format.
