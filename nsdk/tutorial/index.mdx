# Cardinal Tutorials

In this section you will find several self-contained and runnable tutorials that explore
the main functionalities and use cases of the Cardinal SDK.

- [Introductory tutorial](/tutorial/basic/sdk-basic-tutorial): this tutorial will
help you making the first step with the Cardinal SDK. It explains how to create patients 
and medical data, how to share data among doctors and patients, how to search data and how
to use codification systems. The full code of the tutorial is available
[here](https://github.com/icure/cardinal-introductory-tutorial) for Kotlin, Python, and Typescript. The Dart tutorial 
code is instead available [in this repo](https://github.com/icure/cardinal-dart-introductory-tutorial).
- [Real-time communication tutorial](/tutorial/pubsub/): this tutorial will follow the
use case of a patient-oriented application that publishes medical data and a backend 
service (e.g. an AI algorithm) that has to  perform an analysis whenever a new piece of
information is created. The full code of the tutorial is available [here](https://github.com/icure/cardinal-real-time-analysis-tutorial)
