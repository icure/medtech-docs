# Real-time Communication and Analysis Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates an example application with two concurrent components: a **publisher** and a **subscriber**.

- **Publisher**: Simulates a patient application where a device measures the [blood glucose level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level) and creates a new reading using Cardinal.
- **Subscriber**: Receives the created medical data in real time and modifies it with the analysis results.

This example is useful for scenarios where a backend service (e.g., an AI algorithm) needs to continuously analyze data 
as soon as it's created.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. Completed the [onboarding procedure](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-create-your-account) to register for Cardinal.
2. Created a database and [added a healthcare party user](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-manage-hcp).
3. Familiarized yourself with the Cardinal SDK by following the [introductory tutorial](/tutorial/basic/sdk-basic-tutorial).

:::note
Be sure to [generate an authentication token](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-manage-hcp#generating-an-authentication-token) (i.e.
a temporary password) for your healthcare party to be able to instantiate the SDK in the code examples.
