# Run the Example

You can run the example by executing the Subscriber application and then the Publisher application. Below you will 
find the instruction on how to run them in the different programming languages.

Be sure of running the Subscriber first, as the subscription will only be triggered by services created after the 
initialization.

:::warning
Both the Publisher and the Subscriber will ask for a login and a password. You can use the email and an authentication
token for a healthcare party user [created through the Cockpit](/cockpit/how-to/how-to-manage-hcp).

Make sure to use the same credentials for both the Publisher and Subscriber. The patient created in the Publisher will 
share data with the healthcare party associated with the logged-in credentials, and the Subscriber can only access the 
services that have been shared with that same healthcare party.
:::

:::info
The Publisher and Subscriber are fully interoperable, even if they are written in different programming languages. 
For example, you could run the Publisher in Kotlin and the Subscriber in Python, and you would achieve the same result 
as if both were written in the same language.

## Prerequisite

Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/icure/cardinal-real-time-analysis-tutorial) and navigate to the folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/icure/cardinal-real-time-analysis-tutorial.git
cd cardinal-real-time-analysis-tutorial
```

## Launch the Tutorial using Kotlin

Open the project folder using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and wait for the indexing to finish.
When it finishes, run the `main` function in the `Subscriber.kt` file to run the Subscriber and the `main` functon in 
the `Publisher.kt` file to run the Publisher.

## Launch the Tutorial using Python

To launch the tutorial in Python, navigate to the `python` folder in the tutorial repository. The minimum supported 
Python version is 3.9.

```bash
cd python
```

It is a good practice to set up a virtual environment to avoid conflict in dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the Cardinal sdk from PyPi.

```bash
pip install cardinal-sdk
```

Then you can run the Subscriber.

```bash
python src/subscriber.py
```

Finally, open a new terminal, navigate again to the python folder and ensure that the virtual environment is activated.

```bash
cd cardinal-real-time-analysis-tutorial/python
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now you can run the Publisher.

```bash
python src/publisher.py
```

## Launch the Tutorial using Typescript

To launch the Publisher and Subscriber in Typescript, you need a version of node >= 19. You can install it using
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). You will also need the `yarn` package manager.

```bash
nvm install 19
nvm use 19
npm install -G yarn
```

Now, navigate to the `typescript` directory in the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd typescript
yarn install
```

You can now run the Subscriber:

```bash
yarn ts-node --esm src/subscriber.ts
```

Then, open another terminal, navigate to the `typescript` folder, activate node 19 and run the Publisher.

```bash
cd cardinal-real-time-analysis-tutorial/python
nvm use 19
yarn ts-node --esm src/publisher.ts
```
